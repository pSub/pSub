### Hi there, I'm Pascal Wittmann ðŸ‘‹

I am a software developer from Hamburg, Germany. My focus is the backend. However, I do not mind taking a glimpse into the frontend from time to time.

Some facts about me:

- I love free and open-source software
- I want to understand the things I work with properly
- I like to have a strong compiler by my side
- I admire elegant code and sometimes I get lost in it
